        Create your first app with ARHeadsetKit, using basic AR objects.
        
<!--    After finishing tutorial 4, replace this with a wider picture that shows the cool objects. Rearrange them for the landscape mode photo and make the animated color static. Make the color the same as the tutorial 4 intro picture/section 2 picture   -->
