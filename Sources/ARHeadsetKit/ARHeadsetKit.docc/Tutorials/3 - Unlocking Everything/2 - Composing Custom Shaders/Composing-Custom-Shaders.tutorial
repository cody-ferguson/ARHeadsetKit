<!--   Learn how to create vertex shaders rendering in ARHeadsetKit.   -->
<!--   Introduce MTLLayeredBuffer here.   -->

<!--   State that Metal Shading Language is a variation of C++. If you have used that before, this will be familiar.   -->

            There is the bug that breaks Metal syntax coloring, which Apple hasn't implemented yet. You will fix it by modifying the corrupted file in Xcode.
            
            Apple, if you're reading this, you know what to do :)

<!--   Make the ripple effect idea with complex shaders here, instead of branching into a fourth chapter. The ray tracing section will let people control the ripple with their hand. Then, the tutorial for fragment/compute shaders will complete it.    -->
