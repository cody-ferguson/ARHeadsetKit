## Viewing Documentation

To view ARHeadstKit's tutorials and an organized listing of functions, check out [this article](building-documentation.md).

To view documentation for a specific symbol while working on source code:
1. Right-click on any ARHeadsetKit type or function in your Swift source code.
1. Click "Quick Help".
1. In the popup, click "Open in Developer Documentation".

The documentation viewer only supports Swift code, not ARHeadsetKit's Metal utility functions. Metal code will only show documentation in the "Quick Help" panel.

> Note: The "Open in Developer Documentation" link may not appear for Swift types and functions when another Xcode project was opened recently. If that happens, restart Xcode and open just the project you intend to work on. After that, you may open others.
