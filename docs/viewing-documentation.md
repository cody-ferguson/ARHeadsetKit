## Viewing documentation

Press `Cmd + Shift + 0` to open the documentation viewer. Either "ARHeadsetKit" or your project's name will appear at the top of the list of frameworks on the left, with a blue Xcode logo next to it. Click the arrow to the left of that logo to reveal sub-sections for ARHeadsetKit, DeviceKit, and ZippyJSON. To open ARHeadsetKit's tutorials, click "Welcome to ARHeadsetKit".

To view documentation for a specific symbol while working on source code, you can also:
- Right-click on any ARHeadsetKit type or function in your Swift source code
- Click "Quick Help"
- In the popup, click "Open in Developer Documentation"

The documentation viewer only supports Swift code, not ARHeadsetKit's Metal utility functions. Metal code will only show documentation in the "Quick Help" pane.

> Note: The "Open in Developer Documentation" link may not appear for Swift types and functions when another Xcode project was opened recently. If that happens, restart Xcode and open the project you intend to work on before any others.
